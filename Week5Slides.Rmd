# Week 5: Turning you Loose

Co-presenter: Carolyn Hoffman (fellow R user, Training & Technical Assistance)

## Logistics

- No demo today!

- Please send questions/comments to the chat or raise your hand if you need to ask a question and I can unmute you. 

- I'm going to leave the readme at the GitHub link up as a resource, links to recordings, homework instructions, etc. ~~Contact me directly if you have any questions.~~

- We're going to talk about where you can find help going forward!

## The R Community landscape

A little tension between base R crowd and RStudio crowd but mostly everyone agrees to live and let live. Use what makes you and your co-developers happy.

R is free and open source. It's maintained by developers who know and care about the language and its future and who are generally not paid for their work. There's a dynamic where often this arrangement becomes unsustainable. 

RStudio is a B Corp, and maintains the Tidyverse and shinyapps.io and a number of server products. They also contribute a lot to the maintenance of R as a language.

## How do I get help if I have an issue?

Continuum of effort, ascending order:

1. In the console, type `?mutate`, read the R documentation.
2. In the console, type `vignette("dplyr")` (or another package)
3. Google
    * Searching on "R" is obviously difficult but it does work if the rest of your search is more specific. There's also rseek.org. 
    * Paste error message
    * Search package name and problem
    * You'll often end up on StackOverflow. Usually your answer is there!
4. RStudio Community
5. Slack (your local R-Ladies or the HMIS Help Slack #r-learners channel)

## What if I Need to Ask for Help

* Follow guidelines of whatever site you are posting to. Stackoverflow has a template and a series of questions to ask yourself before posting. Most sites do these days.
* Include information about what you've tried, be clear about what exactly you are expecting the code to do, include the exact error message, etc.
* It helps to create a reproducible example of your problem for whoever is going to try to help you wherever possible. Get to know the reprex package!
